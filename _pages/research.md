> My main research focus is on machine learning, computer vision, VR/AR and gaming. 

Currently, my research focus is on synthetic data and virtual sensors for lab-based preparation of ML applications for reality. For modeling and data generation I use Blender and own plugins, which I combine with ML algorithms like GANs and AE. In my doctoral thesis I dealt with the application of neural networks (MLP, RNN/LSTM, hybrids) in time series prediction in air traffic. Besides multidimensional modeling, I have been able to extract knowledge from neural networks by using genetic algorithms.

In my research I mainly code in Python and C++. For ML applications I use TensorFlow, sklearn, pytorch and YOLO. I regularly work with the game engines UE4 and Godot and use the software Blender to design and simulate virtual worlds.

I published in several traffic and informatics related journals and participated in international conferences. In addition to my scientific work I am student of Informatics at the University Hagen and game developer in a small game dev studio in Dresden.
