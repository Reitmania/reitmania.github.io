I am research fellow in Bernhard Jung's group at the TU Bergakademie Freiberg, Chair of Virtual Reality & Multimedia. Currently, my research focus is on synthetic data and virtual sensors for lab-based preparation of ML applications for reality. For modeling and data generation I use Blender and own plugins, which I combine with ML algorithms like GANs and AE. During my PhD phase I worked on the prediction of complex time series in aviation, especially by LSTMs. 
I published in several traffic and informatics related journals and participated in international conferences. In addition to my scientific work I am student of Informatics at the University Hagen and game developer in a small game dev studio in Dresden.

I am always interested in new contacts for joint work in ML, Computer Vision and Visualization.
