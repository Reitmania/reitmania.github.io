I am research fellow at Lund University in the Robotics and Semantic Systems group and PostDoc in Bastian Pfleging's group at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology. Currently I work on applications of intelligent autonomous systems, especially mobile robots and their simulation, as well as VR/AR applications, e.g. assistance systms for telerobotics. My research focus is on applied machine learning, robotics and human-computer interaction.

I am always interested in new contacts for joint work and collaborations!
