I am research fellow in Bernhard Jung's group at the TU Bergakademie Freiberg, Chair of Virtual Reality & Multimedia. Currently, my research focus is on synthetic data and virtual sensors for lab-based preparation of ML applications for reality. 

I am always interested in new contacts for joint work in ML, Computer Vision and Visualization.
