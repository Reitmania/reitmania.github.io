I am research fellow at Lund University in the Robotics and Semantic Systems group and PostDoc in Bastian Pfleging's group at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology. Currently I work on applications of intelligent autonomous systems, especially mobile robots and their simulation. My research focus is on machine learning, robotic simulation, and VR/AR assistance systems for telerobotics.

I am always interested in new contacts for joint work in machine learning, robotics and VR / AR.
