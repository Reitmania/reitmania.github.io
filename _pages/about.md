I am Assistant Professor for Pervasive Computing Systems at Chemnitz University of Technology and research fellow at Lund University in the Robotics and Semantic Systems group. Before that I was PostDoc in Bastian Pfleging's and Bernhard Jung's group at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology. Currently I work on applications of intelligent autonomous systems, especially mobile robots and their simulation, as well as VR/AR applications, e.g. assistance systems for telerobotics. My research focus is on applied machine learning, robotics, ubiquitous computing and human-computer interaction.

I am always interested in new contacts for joint work and collaborations!
