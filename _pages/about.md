I am research fellow in Bernhard Jung's group at the TU Bergakademie Freiberg, Chair of Virtual Reality & Multimedia, and research group leader in the ESF project *RoboBoatAssist*. Currently I work on applications of intelligent autonomous systems, especially mobile robots and their simulation. My research focus is on machine learning, robotic simulation, and VR/AR assistance systems for telerobotics.

I am always interested in new contacts for joint work in machine learning, robotics and VR / AR.
