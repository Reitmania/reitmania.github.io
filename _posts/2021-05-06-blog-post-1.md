Hey there! 

I decided to add a little blog to my page. I don't want to post regularly, but I like to share my experiences about working in the research sector, about making science with linux and open source tools, and of course about other stuff from time to time. 

Within the last years I gained a lot of experience about working in science. About getting a pipeline for myself in publishing, finding the right tools for scientic paper writing, finding the best journal or conference and so on. Maybe some of this stuff may help you (or you have additional advices for me - would be great!). 

Sometimes I get very thoughtful about the common problems in science, especially about the bad contract situation for young scientists. And of course some other problems, which also link my thoughts to politics and society. I think, there will be no shortage on topics :)

See you soon!
Stefan
